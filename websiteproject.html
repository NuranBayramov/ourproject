        <p class="description">Wow! Creating a website was actually harder than I thought! For our website project as a team some of us did their own individual parts, while some of us didn't. Some didn't even bother to join the github. But that's how life is, isn't it? You have got to do what needs to be done yourself, instead of relying on someone else. Because it is highly likely to have bad consequences. Anyway, it was still a joyful experience and I'm sure I will use the experience I got from here a lot in my upcoming career. </p>

        <p class="description">Welcome to my website project! I went for a black and white design, because in my opinion, simpler is better. In the homepage, you will see custom greetings, which will greet you based on the time of the day. That was created with the help of JavaScript. There is also a surprise for you if you go on the website from 12 to 6 am :D. Coming to the CSS part, as I mentioned, I went for a simple black and white design. Moving the mouse to the page you want to go to on the homepage will give you a hover effect, which was also created with the help CSS. The navigation bar at the top of the homepage was created using HTML and styled with the help of CSS. 
            For the Hour of Code event video, I used the iframe feature which was provided by the application itself. To make the images on the website look more aligned with the style, I used border radius. That's when I encountered a minor problem, which was images not fitting properly in the boxes, but I handled it later on by doing further research on CSS. Moving on to the photos from the event, I encountered another issue there, which was images nesting together, looking weird. To deal with this I again did research and found out about display flex and flex wrap-wrap. Using these, I successfully solved the problem.
