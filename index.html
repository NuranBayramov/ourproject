        <p class="description">If you're wondering where the name Matrix even came from, I have no idea either. Perhaps we're not dodging bullets, but like Neo in the Matrix, we are learning to see the code that underlies the world around us. I guess I just took inspiration from that. Anyway, this website is for our Principles of Information Systems assignment. We are Matrix, a group of 4 information systems students. You can find information about each team member, our website project, along with the Hour of Code event that we, as a team organized. Interesting enough? Hop in!</p>
