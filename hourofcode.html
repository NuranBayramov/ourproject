        <h1 class="title">How our hour of code event went</h1>
        <p class="description">Feeding those with a hunger of learning was a joyful experience for us. That is exactly the whole point of the Hour of Code event, introducing beginners to the fundamentals of coding with games and engaging activities. Showing them that coding is, indeed, a fun activity, was our whole purpose as a team. To be more exact, for our Hour of Code project, we went to School Number 6 at Baku to show fifth graders how the world of coding operates! They found it pretty amusing to learn coding using visual aids of popular videogames like Minecraft and Angry Birds. Although we were not expecting it to go as smoothly as it did, it all went pretty well, since Code.Org uses engaging and interactive activities to teach beginners how to code, it made it pretty easy for us as well. It was also our first time, which made it kind of stressful. But, we enjoyed every minute of it! The course that we used deserves a lot of credit as well, because not only it clearly explains to beginner level programmers how the world of coding operates, but also trains their logic by making them think of solutions that are as optimized as possible, with fewer blocks. It was a lot of work completing the whole course ourselves, though, as the ones arranging the whole event, since there were a lot of similar concepts with just different visuals, it took us a long time. However, despite some minor flaws, it's safe to say that the students had a pretty good time learning about the basics of computer science!</p>
